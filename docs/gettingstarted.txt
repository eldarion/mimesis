Getting started
===============

This document is designed to get you up and running with mimesis. This app is
designed for use with Django_, however, can be used with Pinax_. Pinax can
provide some extra components which will enhance the functionality of mimesis.
Those extra components are designed for Django too and Pinax simply brings
them together.


Prerequisites
=============

These are the requirements to run mimesis:

 * Python **2.5+** (Python 3.x is **not** supported yet)
 * Django **1.2+**
 * djagno-taggit **0.8.0**

Some packages that will be immensely useful, but not required, are:

 * sorl-thumbnail **3.2.5**


Installation
============

To install mimesis use pip_:

.. code-block:: none

    pip install mimesis

Add mimesis to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        "mimesis",
    ]

Hook up mimesis to your URLconf:

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns = patterns("",
        # ...
        url(r"^media/", include("mimesis.urls"))
    )

This is largely all you need to do to get mimesis setup in your project.
Continue reading on to learn more about how to use mimesis.


Usage
=====

If you want to use a flash uploader, like ``swfupload`` with jQuery's uploadify_
you'll need to set ``MIMESIS_USE_FLASH_UPLOAD`` to ``True`` so that the the
upload handler will do the right thing with regards to session data since the
user's authenticated session cookie will not be sent on the Flash POST.

.. code-block:: python

    MIMESIS_USE_FLASH_UPLOAD = True
